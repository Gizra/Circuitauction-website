                <p>You have the following rights in relation to your Data:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Right to access</strong> - the right to request (i) copies of the information we hold about you at any time, or (ii) that we modify, update or delete such information.

                <p>If you are not satisfied with the way a complaint you make in relation to your Data is handled by us, you may be able to refer your complaint to the relevant data protection authority.

                <p>It is important that the Data we hold about you is accurate and current. Please keep us informed if your Data changes during the period for which we hold it.</p>

                <p>We will only transfer Data outside the EEA where it is compliant with data protection legislation and the means of transfer provides adequate safeguards in relation to your data.</p>
                
                <p>To ensure that your Data receives an adequate level of protection, we have put in place appropriate safeguards and procedures with the third parties we share your Data with.
