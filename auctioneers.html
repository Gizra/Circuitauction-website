                        <p>Established in 1991, the Carriers and Locals Society is a not-for-profit association of people interested in the carriers, local posts, independent mails and Eastern expresses of the 19th century, their stamps and postal history. The society publishes quarterly a gold medal winning journal, "The Penny Post", and is dedicated to furthering the understanding of private mail companies in the United States during the nineteenth century.</p>
                        <p>The Society works to study the stamps, markings, and postal history of both private mail companies and government carrier services, while also cataloging the reprints, fakes, and fantasies of these issues. Their expertise in this specialized area of philately makes them a valuable partner for collectors and auction houses alike.</p>

                        <p>The Romano House of Stamps was founded in 1994 by Moshe and Mira Romano. The business has grown from a stamp store for local collectors to an international auction center for philatelic, numismatic and Judaica items serving collectors and consignors from every continent on the globe. Moshe had been a lifelong collector who was able to successfully turn his passions into his career. The company has always been a family business with family pride. Mira, formerly an attorney, has been vital in all the day-to-day operations of a growing company. Their daughter Sharon joined the firm in 2001 to assist in expanding the auction, especially to collectors overseas. The family's efforts have been a success. They have become a unique source in the Holyland for collectors everywhere.</p>
