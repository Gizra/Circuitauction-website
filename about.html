            <h2>How 60 Years of Collecting Built the World's Best Auction Software</h2>
            <div class="story-content">
                <div class="story-text">
                    <p><strong>It started simple.</strong> Moti Kremener - 60 years of collecting, international judge, respected appraiser - asked his son Joe: "Build us a website for collectors."</p>
                    
                    <p>That simple request changed everything.</p>
                    
                    <p>Joe, studying computer science, created <strong>the world's first website that sold stamps directly online</strong>. What began as a small project for fellow collectors exploded into StampCircuit - a major portal serving collectors globally.</p>
                    
                    <p><strong>Then came the breakthrough.</strong></p>
                    
                    <p>After 15 years working with collectors, Joe realized auction house software was broken. It was built by people who never ran an auction, never handled consignments, never understood what collectors actually wanted.</p>
                    
                    <p>So he assembled an extraordinary team.</p>
                    
                    <p><strong>Enter Amitai and Brice</strong> - now Circuit partners who contribute to Drupal core and build enterprise systems for Harvard, the UN, and the White House. Through their work with Gizra, they've proven they can handle anything.</p>
                    
                    <p><strong>For 10 years</strong>, this team refined the platform with major German auction houses like Heinrich K√∂hler. Real testing. Real feedback. Real results.</p>
                    
                    <p><strong>Today?</strong> Circuit Auction AI powers auction houses worldwide - because it was built by people who speak auction fluently.</p>

                        <p>We believe so, and here's why: We're the only platform built by people with 60 years of collecting experience and 30 years of auction technology development, backed by enterprise developers who build systems for Harvard and the UN.</p>

                        <p>Unlike generic software with auction features added on, Circuit was designed from the ground up by auction industry veterans. We understand collector psychology, consignment workflows, and auction house operations because we've lived them for decades.</p>

                        <p>Absolutely. Our development partners build systems for the White House, Harvard, and the United Nations. The platform has been tested and refined with major European auction houses for over a decade.</p>
